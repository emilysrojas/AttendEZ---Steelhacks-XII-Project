We made a prototype of an interactive calendar that generates codes for each event. Users can log attendance for each event using the 6 letter code generated for the event instead of going through the long process of scanning a QR code and entering their information. Ideally, we would have all school clubs use something like this and people from around the school can see the information for all the clubs they are in in the same calendar. This calendar app encourages people to go to more events and be more social because the points earned from each event creates a sense of accomplishment and makes it easy to see progress. 

We used JavaFX to make the user interface and have a file called Main.java where you can see conceptually how the code logging system works. 

In the future, we would like to develop the interface more since it doesn't work fully. We would also like to be connected to a database where we can store user and event information instead of relying on text files.
